# JasmineGraph Docker Deployment

This guide will help you set up and deploy JasmineGraph using Docker. Weâ€™ll build the frontend and backend services separately, then use Docker Compose to bring everything up.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker-compose (>= 2.36.0)
- Start JasmineGraph Server in Docker mode

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the JasmineGraph repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasminegraph/jasminegraph-ui.git
   cd jasminegraph-ui
   ```

2. **Start the Services with Docker Compose**

   From the root directory of the project, use Docker Compose to start both the frontend and backend services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This command will start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Access the Application**

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

## Stopping the Services

To stop the services, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal which is occupied by `docker compose up`, or in a new terminal run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Deployment Instructions

here the JasmineGraph UI documentation: [documentation](https://github.com/jasminegraph/jasminegraph-ui/blob/feature/graph_visualization2/JasmineGraph-UI-Documentation.pdf)

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to adjust any configurations as needed in your `docker-compose.yml`.
- If you encounter permission issues, try running the Docker commands with `sudo`.

## Troubleshooting

- Check Docker logs if any service fails to start:

  ```bash
  docker logs <container_name>
  ```

- Ensure no other processes are using the same ports specified in your `docker-compose.yml`.
